# PM files for Eddienput
This is a collection of files I made to use for Eddienput. Eddienput is a programmable virtual controller used to do dummy recordings for fighting games. Link: https://github.com/nirgoren/Eddienput

I made a config file for Eddienput, a basic dummy recording and a Dolphin input profile to use.

The config file needs to go into the Eddienput configs folder.

The dummy recordings are written into the recordings folder.

The Dolphin input profile goes into your Dolphin install as such: <Dolphin install folder>/User/Config/Profiles/GCPad

Set port 2 to a standard controller and load this profile.

In training mode, set CPU mode to control.

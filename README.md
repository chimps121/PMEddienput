# PM files for Eddienput
This is a collection of files I made to use for Eddienput. Eddienput is a programmable virtual controller used to do dummy recordings for fighting games. Link: https://github.com/nirgoren/Eddienput

I made a config file for Eddienput, a basic dummy recording and a Dolphin input profile to use.

The config file (pm.json) needs to go into the Eddienput configs folder.

The dummy recordings (pm_test.txt and pm_marth_dashback_vs_dtilt.txt) go into the recordings folder.

The Dolphin input profile (KeyboardEddienput.ini) goes into your Dolphin install as such: <Dolphin install folder>/User/Config/Profiles/GCPad

Set port 2 to a standard controller and load this profile.

In training mode, set CPU mode to control.
